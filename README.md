# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This project is to demonstrate competency in basic JavaScript skills. 

The program is a rock, paper, scissors game. The user will play against the computer. The program will take an input (rock,paper,scissors) from the user and then the computer will get a random input (rock, paper, scissor). The program will compare the user's input against the computer's and determine the winner if there is one.
